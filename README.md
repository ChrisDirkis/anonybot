# anonybot

Allows users to send messages anonymously to a channel.

Built for a specific use case, so not particularly good code, but maybe useful as an example.

- (optional) Create and source a venv (e.g. `python3 -m venv env` and `source env/bin/activate`)
- Install the required packages via `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
